## Read before continue
This simulator is developed based on my own intrest, this is not a tutorial of gamble. Gambling is addictive and risky. If you are not a gambler yet, I suggest do not try gamble at all. If you already interact with casino games, make sure stay in your limit. 

*Remember, house always win. In this simulator, you may find out that under certain strategies, the player might win some money. However, these strategies require lots of practice and not suitable for new players. Therefore, I don't suggest try out in real casino unless you accept lose some money.
